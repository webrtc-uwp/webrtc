I don\u0027t like |ALIVE|, since the caller can\u0027t make any assumptions about liveness from that return value. \n\nMaybe DANGLING, DELETED?\n\nAn enum also have the practical problem that in the current code, there are several implementations of Add/Release, so it\u0027s not obvious where the definition of that typedef would belong.\n\nIn any case, the return value should rarely be used.",

      "message": "\u003e could there be an instance of this class on the stack somewhere?\n\nThere\u0027s one use as a direct member variable in voe_base_unittest.cc. There\u0027s also a subclass FakeAudioDevice, which seems to be handled via a std::unique_ptr in several tests.\n\nThis all looks a bit confused to me. We should either do refcounting, and use scoped_refptr for all instances, or make the base class AudioDeviceModule not inherit RefCountedModule. But not in this cl.\n\nDo you want me to delete or expand the TODO item?",
