      "message": "I would say put this member in the same order as in the spec but maybe the spec order should change? There\u0027s this pattern of video-only and audio-only stuff and then there\u0027s jitterBufferDelay which should be for both audio and video. Doesn\u0027t match the comments I made. Can you move it to before \"// Video-only members\"? Make the .cc file match the order of this file.\n\nAdd a TODO documenting the fact that this is currently only collected for audio, but that it should be collected for video too.",
