      "message": "I\u0027d want to clarify a bit further what the switch to unified plan SDP will mean for this API. Since receivers are never truly removed, will this never be called? That seems reasonable to me; the application can just inspect the \"direction\" attribute, listen for stream change events or \"mute\" events, so there are other ways to get the information.\n\nIn other words: I\u0027m suggesting we define this to be something that\u0027s *only* called when a Plan B RtpReceiver is completely removed.",
