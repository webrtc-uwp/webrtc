      "message": "Excellent. But I realize that the \"you need to own a reference\" restriction applies not only to AddRef and Release, but to all other methods and members too. So maybe something like this at the very top:\n\n  You may access members of a reference-counted object *only* if you already own a reference to it, or if you\u0027re borrowing someone else\u0027s reference.\n\n  AddRef() creates a new reference to the object. As a special exception to the \"you need to own a reference\" rule above, you are allowed (and required) to call AddRef() on a newly constructed object to bring its reference count up from 0 to 1.\n\n...and then the same text from line 25 onwards.",
