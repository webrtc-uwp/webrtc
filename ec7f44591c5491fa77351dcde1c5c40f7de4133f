      "message": "This guy here introduces IsVMInitialized() and AttachCurrentThread() from the Chromium base package. I really don\u0027t understand how their definitions (which should be in base/android/jni_android.cc) get pulled in so the binary can link. We don\u0027t publicly depend on anything in chromium\u0027s base from what I can see, and if I add it a bunch of other things fail to compile. I don\u0027t know how to solve this, so I walled off this file in the gn file so we can gn --check the rest of the test code, at least.",
