      "message": "Oh, I see what\u0027s going on. There are two methods declared in the header, but only one will be defined, depending on the #defines. I\u0027m not a fan of this approach; we use it occasionally in Chromium where there\u0027s a factory method that has the same method signature on all platforms, but the implementation is per-platform. It allows cross-platform code to instantiate a per-platform instance without needing to know the details.\n\nHowever, that\u0027s not the case here. The X11 specific function should be defined in a separate header that\u0027s only included in Linux implementations, since the calling code needs to know the platform details anyway to pass in the correct parameter. Alternatively, you could make XAtomCache a global so you don\u0027t need to pass it in, and have the same method signature on all platforms. That\u0027s probably more work though.",
