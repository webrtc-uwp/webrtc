      "message": "Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.  It\u0027s more like a SessionCache with an Add and a Lookup.  The Adapter (via the callback) needs to call Add and maybe Lookup.  But someone needs to own the cache and pass it to the Adapter.  I guess the owner of the factory could do that instead of owning the factory, and then pass the session into the Adapter instead of having the factory do so.  That sounds pretty good, actually.  It\u0027s kind of the opposite of what I was suggesting.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t call it a \"controller\", though, because it doesn\u0027t own the things it creates like other controllers do.",
