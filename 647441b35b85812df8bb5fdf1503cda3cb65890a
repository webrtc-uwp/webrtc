      "message": "This works fine with scoped_refptr, even if it\u0027s not entirely kosher to convert from raw pointer to scoped_refptr. And it won\u0027t work, as far as I understand, if we ever try to replace scoped_refptr with std::shared_ptr. The Get* functions can be changed to return raw const pointer, but we can\u0027t do that with ToI420.\n\nSo I wonder if you have any plan, or if we\u0027re just punting those issues until we actually try to adopt shared_ptr. Should we ask some c++ expert? I\u0027d wish there were some way to declare a particular method that can be called only on a shared_ptr, making |this| a shared_ptr.",
