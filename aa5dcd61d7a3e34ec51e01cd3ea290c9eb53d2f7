      "message": "I think a better pattern for this would be to provide a new, pure-virtual method that subclasses are then required to override. This class would then provide its own override for OnCaptureResult along the lines of:\n\nvoid OnCaptureResult(result, frame) {\n  modified_result \u003d ...\n  modified_frame \u003d ...\n  OnBeforeCaptureResultNotify(modified_result, modified_frame);\n  callback_-\u003eOnCaptureResult(result, frame);\n}\n\nBetter still, consider providing a second callback for observers so that you don\u0027t need to subclass CaptureResultDesktopCapturerWrapper--you just invoke observer_callback_-\u003eOnCaptureResult() before callback_-\u003eOnCaptureResult(). Google \"prefer composition over inheritance\" for why this pattern is better in most cases.\n\nThe details are not very clear to me, however. For example, why is sanity-checking the |result| and |frame| parameters intrinsically tied to observing them? They seem unrelated to me.",
