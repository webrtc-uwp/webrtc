It seems to me like an incidental. I think the preferable behavior would be to only have the resolution trigger one callback per given observer, but still trigger for observers added after the first resolutions. (Testing *that* might be overkill; IIRC, discussing this with @danilchap, we could not think of a case where observers would be added after a resolution.)",
