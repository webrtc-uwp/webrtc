I\u0027m okay with that option.\n\nOtherwise, if I understand Danil\u0027s answer correctly, I think the simplest behavior is \"if there is an RRID, ignore the RSID; the RRID itself is treated in a way equivalent to an RSID, for the case of RSID-only.\" I would be happy with that, too.",

If you haven\u0027t done so already, you might want to check with Taylor and Peter about the value; they might know about upcoming big-group support. (I have no preference myself; 1000 is just fine with me.)",
