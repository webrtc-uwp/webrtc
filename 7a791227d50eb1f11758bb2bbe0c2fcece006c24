      "message": "This got really complex now. Is it a good idea to have two targets here, while only one is supposed to throw an error (the second, I guess?).\n\nDo we even handle all the combinations that are possible with if-conditions? I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s even possible for us to write a safe check that handles all possible variations? It seems we need to evaluate the platforms and get the \"end-result sources\" list for each platform in order to do this check properly. It may be overkill but I don\u0027t know if this current check might fail on some of our existing targets - maybe we can run it on our current codebase?",
