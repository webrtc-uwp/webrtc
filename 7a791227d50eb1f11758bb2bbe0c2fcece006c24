      "message": "This got really complex now. Is it a good idea to have two targets here, while only one is supposed to throw an error (the second, I guess?).\n\nDo we even handle all the combinations that are possible with if-conditions? I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s even possible for us to write a safe check that handles all possible variations? It seems we need to evaluate the platforms and get the \"end-result sources\" list for each platform in order to do this check properly. It may be overkill but I don\u0027t know if this current check might fail on some of our existing targets - maybe we can run it on our current codebase?",

      "message": "This is actually finding 3 errors:\n- the first target is using +\u003d to mix source files;\n- the second target is using both +\u003d and a single initialization of a list that violates this check.\nlen(errors) it is still one because we are only dealing with one file, but there are 3 errors in the error message.\n\nYes, you are right on the second point. That should be the way to go, but it is also overkill so maybe this is a good trade off. Consider that we should run a check also on all the possible gn args, so the test matrix can grow a lot...\n\nLet me run the check on the whole code base before landing.",
